# Surveillance_Network_Indigenous_Mobility

This directory contains the optimized sentinel network model for early pathogen detection in Brazil, integrating human mobility and Indigenous population coverage. It proposes a more efficient arrangement of 199 cities, improving mobility coverage and ensuring surveillance in underserved regions, including Indigenous areas.

# Guidelines for Reproducing the Analysis

This directory contains all the necessary resources to reproduce the analysis conducted in Oliveira et al. [1].

## Directory Structure:
1. **Input_data**: This folder contains the required input datasets to run the optimization algorithm and perform the descriptive analysis as described in Oliveira et al. [1]. These datasets are essential for understanding and executing the analysis.
2. **Script**: The folder contains the Python scripts used for data processing, optimization, and analysis. All the code required to reproduce the results can be found here.
3. **Results**: This folder includes the list of optimized sentinel locations, along with the outputs of the analysis.

## Reproducing the Analysis:
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this directory to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
